# Tiku-Gaelle
My  Readme

Hello, i am called Ako Tiku Brenda Gaelle, a bachelorette studying Computer Science at the Unversity of Buea. I am 19 years old, and fluent in both English and French. I live in Buea, South West Region, Cameroon.
I am passionate about software development, and have had a hard time finding a path to my dreams, but i do have now. I started off with Web development, learning just the basics like HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. 
And then I moved on to programming, starting with C. From C, i moved on to python, C++, and  Java. I did not go in-depth with any of these languages, completing just in-course, and smaller side projects with them.
Presently, I am learning Dart with flutter, though still a beginner, i hope to improve my skills as time goes on.

Lastly, I have resulted to comitting weekly challenges, to boost up my skills. These commits, need not be flutter or related only to programming, a little Web development, added with UI/UX designs (which are no where near good, because i'm still a beginner) once in a while, I figured would also be good.

Thank you.
